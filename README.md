# Python_Projects
Monster_fight is a short and simple text-based game. I created it after completing my PCEP certification to reinforce my understanding of 
data structures and functions. The code contains lists, tuples, a dictionary, and multiple functions. If you have python installed, simply 
download the game and run it by typing: python3 Monster_Fight.py
Good hunting!
